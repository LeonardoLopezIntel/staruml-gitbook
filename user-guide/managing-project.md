# Managing Project

## New Project

To create a modeling project, press `Ctrl+N` or select **File \| New**.

## New Project from Template

You can start a modeling project by selecting a template. To start a project with a template, select **File \| New From Template \| \[TemplateName\]**. StarUML supports 4 default templates:

* **UMLMinimal** - A single model with UML Standard Profile.
* **UMLConventional** - Use Case Model, Analysis Model, Design Model, Implementation Model, and Deployment Model with UML Standard Profile.
* **4+1 View Model** - Pilippe Kruchten's [4+1 Architectural View Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model).
* **Rational** : Approach of Rational Rose Tool.
* **Data Model** : A simple data modeling project.

If you don't want to use pre-defined templates, you need to make your own project structure.

If you have StarUML V1 model files \(`.uml`\), you can import by selecting **File \| Import \| StarUML 1 File \(.uml\)...**.

## Save Project

You can save the working project into a file by pressing `Ctrl+S` or selecting **File \| Save**. If you want to save as another file, press `Ctrl+Shift+S` or select **File \| Save As...**.

## Close Project

To close working project, select **File \| Close**. If you didn't saved the project, you will be asked to save or not.

## Import Fragment

To import a fragment into the project, select **File \| Import \| Fragment...**. The fragment will be included as a child of the project.
